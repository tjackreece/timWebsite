			<p>
				Ever since I was a kid, I loved solving puzzles. As I matured, I fell in
				love with mathematics and saw math problems as simple puzzles to be
				solved. My love for computers helped grow my passion for web
				development. The satisfaction of solving a difficult problem was a
				reward in and of itself. With each project, I gained new knowledge and
				problem solving skills. I define myself by the artistic and functional
				capabilites I develop in my projects. While skills can be taught, my
				work ethic and perserverance are two characteristics I pride myself
				upon. Additionally, I strive to continue learning, challenging myself,
				and constucting projects of significanct value.
